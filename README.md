This Art Piece is intended to be a live canvas of PixelArt. 
 Everytime it generates a new composition based on different
 factors such as the size of the pixels, velocities, direction
 and line lenghts. 
 See for yourself the compositions not expected, color harmonies
 and decipher the pattern. Hope you like it.
